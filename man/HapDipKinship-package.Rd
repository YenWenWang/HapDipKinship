\title{HapDipKinship: HapDipKinship: Kinship estimation in haploid-diploid populations}
\description{
This package is for estimating kinship and simulating pedigrees in a haploid-diploid mixed dataset.
}
\details{
New algorithms are developed to estimate kinships among haploid and diploid individuals.
They are largely inspired by KING-robust (Manichaikul, et al. 2010).
The package also offers some simple simulation to test the algorithms.
